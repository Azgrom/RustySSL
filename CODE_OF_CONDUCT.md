# Code of Conduct

## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, a pledge is made by contributors and maintainers to ensure participation in this project and community remains a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

Certain behaviors contribute to creating a positive environment, and these include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Showing respect for differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what benefits the community
- Displaying empathy towards other community members

Conversely, certain unacceptable behaviors by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers hold the responsibility of clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take suitable and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers also reserve the right and hold the responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at rs_shield@pm.me. All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and resolved in a manner that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team commits to maintaining confidentiality concerning the reporter of an incident. More details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who fail to adhere to or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
