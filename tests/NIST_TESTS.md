# Quick brief on these integration tests

The objective of these assertions is to provide s referential to long messages correctness hashing.

These tests assert that each produced hash, from this project implementations, matches with the randomly hashes generated by the *National Institute of Security and Technology* (NIST), via its *Secure Hash Algorithm Validation System* (SHAVS) with the purpose of recognize and homologate an implementation conformance to its Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 180-4 standard.
