# `rs_seed`
Hello, and welcome to the `rs_seed` crate. This crate is meant to provide an implementation of the `rs_seed` cryptographic hashing algorithm. However, we want you to know that this is currently a work-in-progress and is not yet ready for use.

## Under Development
This crate is under active development, and we are working hard to provide a high-quality, efficient implementation of the `rs_seed` algorithm as soon as possible. We appreciate your interest and patience. We'll keep this repository updated with the progress of the project.

## Temporary Behavior
Until the `rs_seed` algorithm is fully implemented and released, please note that any use of this crate will result in a panic. This is by design and is our way of ensuring that this crate is not used prematurely in any production environment or security-sensitive application.

Please keep an eye on this repository for future updates. We look forward to releasing the `rs_seed` crate soon!

Thank you for your understanding and patience.

## Contributions
While we're actively developing this implementation, we also welcome contributions! If you're an enthusiastic developer with experience in Rust and cryptographic algorithms and would like to contribute to the development of the `rs_seed` implementation, we would be glad to have your help! Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines and rules about contributing to this project.

Please keep an eye on this repository for future updates. We look forward to releasing the `rs_seed` crate soon!

Thank you for your understanding and patience.
