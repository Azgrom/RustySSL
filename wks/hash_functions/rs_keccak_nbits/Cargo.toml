description = """`rs_keccak_nbits` is a Rust implementation of the variable-output-length Keccak cryptographic hash
algorithm, part of the larger `rs_ssl` project. This package provides Keccak hashing functionality in a standalone
manner, ideal for when only Keccak with custom output length is required. Alternatively, for those seeking a
comprehensive set of cryptographic functions, this same algorithm is included within the broader `rs_ssl` library
bundle. The focus of `rs_keccak_nbits` and the larger project is on performance, safety, and openness, with a commitment
to ongoing maintenance and enhancement."""
