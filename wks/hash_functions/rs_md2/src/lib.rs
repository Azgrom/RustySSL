//! # MD2 - `rs_md2` - Message Digest Algorithm 2
//!
//! **Important Note: This crate is still a work in progress and is not ready for consumption.**
//!
//! MD2 is a cryptographic hash function designed by Ronald Rivest in 1989. Though its usage has declined over the years, it has been historically applied in several contexts such as:
//! - Digital Signature Standard.
//! - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems.
//! - Secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), etc.
//!
//! This crate implements MD2 as part of the [RustyShield](https://docs.rs/rs_shield/latest/rs_shield/) project.
