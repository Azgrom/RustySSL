//! # MD4 - `rs_md4` - Message Digest Algorithm 4
//!
//! **Important Note: This crate is still a work in progress and is not ready for consumption.**
//!
//! MD4 is a cryptographic hash function designed by Ronald Rivest in 1990. It's considered to be broken in terms of security, but has been historically used in various applications including:
//! - The NT LAN Manager (NTLM) security protocols in Microsoft Windows.
//! - The File Verification feature in the BSD UNIX operating system.
//! - Secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), etc.
//!
//! This crate implements MD4 as part of the [RustyShield](https://docs.rs/rs_shield/latest/rs_shield/) project.
