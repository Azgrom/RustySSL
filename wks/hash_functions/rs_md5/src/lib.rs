//! # MD5 - `rs_md5` - Message Digest Algorithm 5
//!
//! **Important Note: This crate is still a work in progress and is not ready for consumption.**
//!
//! MD5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991. Although it is now considered to be broken in terms of security, it has been historically used in a variety of security and data integrity applications, including:
//! - Digital signatures.
//! - Certificate fingerprints in the X.509 digital certificate standard.
//! - Secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), etc.
//!
//! This crate implements MD5 as part of the [RustyShield](https://docs.rs/rs_shield/latest/rs_shield/) project.
