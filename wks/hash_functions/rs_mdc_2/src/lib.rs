//! # MDC-2 - `rs_mdc_2` - Modification Detection Code 2
//!
//! **Important Note: This crate is still a work in progress and is not ready for consumption.**
//!
//! MDC-2 is a cryptographic hash function designed in 1987. Although it is less known, it has been used in niche cryptographic systems and for research purposes. As a hash function, it can be used in various applications such as:
//! - Digital signatures.
//! - Data integrity checks.
//! - Secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), etc.
//!
//! This crate implements MDC-2 as part of the [RustyShield](https://docs.rs/rs_shield/latest/rs_shield/) project.
