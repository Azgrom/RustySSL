//! # RIPEMD-160 - `rs_ripemd_160` - RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest
//!
//! **Important Note: This crate is still a work in progress and is not ready for consumption.**
//!
//! RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash function designed in 1996 as part of the EU's project RIPE (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation). Although less common, it is used in a variety of applications such as:
//! - Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency address generation.
//! - Data integrity checks.
//! - Secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), etc.
