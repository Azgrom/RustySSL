description = """`rs_sha1` is a Rust implementation of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm, part of the larger
`rs_shield` project. This package provides SHA-1 hashing functionality in a standalone manner, ideal for when only SHA-1
is required. Alternatively, for those seeking a comprehensive set of cryptographic functions, this same algorithm is
included within the broader `rs_shield` library bundle. The focus of `rs_sha1` and the larger project is on performance,
safety, and openness, with a commitment to ongoing maintenance and enhancement."""
