description = """`rs_sha384` is a Rust implementation of the SHA-384 cryptographic hash algorithm, part of the larger
`rs_shield` project. This package provides SHA-384 hashing functionality in a standalone manner, ideal for when only
SHA-384 is required. Alternatively, for those seeking a comprehensive set of cryptographic functions, this same
algorithm is included within the broader `rs_shield` library bundle. The focus of `rs_sha384` and the larger project is
on performance, safety, and openness, with a commitment to ongoing maintenance and enhancement."""
