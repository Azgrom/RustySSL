description = """`rs_sha512` is a Rust implementation of the SHA-512 cryptographic hash algorithm, part of the larger
`rs_ssl` project. This package provides SHA-512 hashing functionality in a standalone manner, ideal for when only
SHA-512 is required. Alternatively, for those seeking a comprehensive set of cryptographic functions, this same
algorithm is included within the broader `rs_ssl` library bundle. The focus of `rs_sha512` and the larger project is on
performance, safety, and openness, with a commitment to ongoing maintenance and enhancement."""
