description = """`rs_shake256` is a Rust implementation of the SHAKE256 cryptographic hash algorithm, part of the larger
`rs_ssl` project. This package provides SHAKE256 hashing functionality in a standalone manner, ideal for when only
SHAKE256 is required. Alternatively, for those seeking a comprehensive set of cryptographic functions, this same
algorithm is included within the broader `rs_ssl` library bundle. The focus of `rs_shake256` and the larger project is
on performance, safety, and openness, with a commitment to ongoing maintenance and enhancement."""
