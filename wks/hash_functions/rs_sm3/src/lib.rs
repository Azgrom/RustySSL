//!
//! **Important Note: This crate is still a work in progress and is not ready for consumption.**
//!
//! SM3 is a cryptographic hash function published by the Chinese National Standard in 2010. While it is predominantly used within China, it does find its applications in:
//! - Digital signatures and certificates for secure communication protocols.
//! - Data integrity checks.
//! - Secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), etc.
//!
//! This crate implements SM3 as part of the [RustyShield](https://docs.rs/rs_shield/latest/rs_shield/) project.
