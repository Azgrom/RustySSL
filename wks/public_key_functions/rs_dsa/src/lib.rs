//! # DSA - `rs_dsa` - Digital Signature Algorithm
//!
//! **Important Note: This crate is still a work in progress and is not ready for consumption.**
//!
//! Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for digital signatures. It was proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1991. DSA is currently used in various applications such as:
//! - Document signing and verification.
//! - Secure email (S/MIME), code signing, SSL/TLS, IPSEC, etc.
//! - Cryptocurrency wallets for transaction validation.
//!
//! This crate implements the DSA as part of the [RustyShield](https://docs.rs/rs_shield/latest/rs_shield/) project.
