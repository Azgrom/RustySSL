//! # Elliptic Curve - `rs_elliptic_curve` - Elliptic Curve Cryptography
//!
//! **Important Note: This crate is still a work in progress and is not ready for consumption.**
//!
//! Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields, introduced in the mid-1980s. ECC is used in a variety of applications such as:
//! - Internet protocols, including secure web browsing, email, and VPNs.
//! - Blockchain technology, like Bitcoin.
//! - Secure file transfer protocols (SFTP), among others.
//!
//! This crate implements Elliptic Curve Cryptography as part of the [RustyShield](https://docs.rs/rs_shield/latest/rs_shield/) project.
