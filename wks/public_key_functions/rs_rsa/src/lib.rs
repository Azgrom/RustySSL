//! # RSA - `rs_rsa` - Rivest-Shamir-Adleman
//!
//! **Important Note: This crate is still a work in progress and is not ready for consumption.**
//!
//! RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. It is employed in a plethora of applications such as:
//! - Secure email transmission,
//! - Secure remote logins,
//! - Secure internet communication protocols (HTTPS, SSL, TLS), etc.
//!
//! This crate implements RSA as part of the [RustyShield](https://docs.rs/rs_shield/latest/rs_shield/) project.
