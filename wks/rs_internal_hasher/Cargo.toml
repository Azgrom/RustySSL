description = """This package serves as an essential building block within the `rs_ssl` cryptographic library. It is
focused on providing foundational functionality and infrastructure for various cryptographic operations within the
larger project. While this package has been made publicly available to satisfy the dependency requirements of Rust's
cargo system, its utility is predominantly realized in the context of the `rs_ssl` project. Unless you are developing or
 maintaining a component of the `rs_ssl` project, this package might offer limited direct utility. For access to a full
 suite of cryptographic functionalities, consider using the `rs_ssl` library bundle."""
