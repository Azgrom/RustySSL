# RustySSL Internal Package

This package serves as an essential building block within the [`rs_ssl`](https://crates.io/crates/rs_ssl) cryptographic library. It is focused on providing foundational functionality and infrastructure for various cryptographic operations within the larger project.

While this package has been made publicly available to satisfy the dependency requirements of Rust's cargo system, its utility is predominantly realized in the context of the `rs_ssl` project.

## Note
Unless you are developing or maintaining a component of the `rs_ssl` project, this package might offer limited direct utility.

## More Information
For access to a full suite of cryptographic functionalities, consider using the [`rs_ssl` library bundle on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rs_ssl).

You can also check the source code and contribute to the [`rs_ssl` project on GitHub](https://github.com/RustySSL/rs_ssl).
